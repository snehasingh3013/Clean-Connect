# Clean-Connect

: Clean connect dedicated to helping individuals, communities and businesses manage their waste in an environmentally sustainable manner. 
Due to a lack of public awareness, India is facing significant waste management challenges. Inadequate education and infrastructure, cultural norms and attitudes towards waste, and a lack of government policies and regulations all contribute to this. Waste management is not emphasised in education, and there is a shortage of trained professionals. People improperly dispose of waste due to a lack of waste management infrastructure. Cultural attitudes towards waste also contribute to the problem, as waste is perceived to be harmless and the responsibility of others to clean up. Finally, government policies are not enforced or monitored, resulting in noncompliance and inefficient waste disposal. To address this issue, a multifaceted approach involving education, infrastructure development, cultural change, and strong government policies and regulations is required.
Awareness is important in waste management because it can promote proper waste management practises, environmental responsibility, health hazards prevention, innovation, and policy change.
